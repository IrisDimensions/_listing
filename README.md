Public listing of packs
The current list of packs that are featured include:
- The current overworld
- The old overworld
- A factions version of the overworld
- A flat world
- A redstone world

There are currently no other packs (publicly) made available by us, or others (as far as we are aware at this time)

You will mainly be using the current overworld for small changes to the existing,
and the flat world for making an Iris dimension from scratch
